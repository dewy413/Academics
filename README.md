## What is this?

Orginally this was just my academics folder, but I started to realize after a period of time I won't be adding to this anymore. Instead of it being just school related work I want this to be all kinds of stuff that I have learned or found useful. That includes concepts I might have learned in class or in class programming assignment along with stuff I have learned outside of the class room. I plan on keeping it called academics becaue I think that just sounds nice.

Unfortunately, I don't think I have all my files so I will probably be redoing programs as long as I am able to. I know I can get access to the old class information. These are going to be purely programming because I personally don't believe I should put other things here.
