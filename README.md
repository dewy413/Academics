## What is this?

This is just my Academics folder. These are going to be concepts I might have learned in class or in class programming assignment I have done.
Unfortaneutly, I don't think I have all my files so I will probably be redoing programs as long as I am able to. I know I can get access to the old class information. These are going to be purely programming because I personally don't believe I should put other things here.
