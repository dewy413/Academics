## Text Books

[C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures 5th Edition (Physical)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Program-Design-Including-Structures/dp/0538798092) - I started doing some research seeing a lot of people saying this isn't a good instructional textbook and looking back I think I would have to agree. I think it worked for me when I used it just because I have been programming since the 10th grade. 

[A few PDFs Provided by the teacher](https://github.com/dewy413/Academics/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Digital%20Textbooks) - I haven't really looked in any of these, but I am going to and over time I will update this.
