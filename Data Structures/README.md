# Data Structures Fall 2021

> "A Data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data."


(Physical Textbook)[https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Program-Design-Including-Structures/dp/0538798092] - I started doing some research seeing a lot of people saying this isn't a good instructional textbook and looking back I think I would have to agree. I think it worked for me when I used it just because I have been programming since the 10th grade.
